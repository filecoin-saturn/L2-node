# Saturn L2 Node

The Saturn L2 Node is a CDN node for the Saturn network that fetches and caches/persists IPLD Dags serialised as CAR files. It fetches CAR files from origin servers that can serve IPLD data such as the IPFS Gateway and Filecoin SPs.


The L2 node is meant to run on NATT'd home machines. This means that the L2 implementation needs to account for:

1. Limited disk space available for caching CAR files -> we should never exceed the limit set by the home user.
2. Limited uplink and download bandwidths and the uplink speed will be much lower than the download speeds.
3. L2's will be NATT'd and not reachable from the public internet.
4. L2's will have flaky connectivity.

We've documented the important considerations and design of the L2 node that will allows us to build a reliable, low latency and high bandwidth CDN abstraction on top of these resource contrained homne machines with flaky connectivity at https://pl-strflt.notion.site/Building-the-Saturn-L2-network-and-L1-L2-interplay-6518deda51344a9db04bd3037b270ada.

The document also details the implementation path we will be taking to eventually build a robust and feature complete MVP for the Saturn L2.

## L2 V0

At present, the L2 implementation is in it's V0 state with the following features:

#### Cache miss to the IPFS Gateway as an origin server

- The L2 node cache misses to the IPFS Gateway as it's origin server. The eventual goal is to cache miss to the Filecoin SP network and will be implemented down the road.

- The L2 node follows the "cache on second miss rule". It only fetches and caches content(read CAR files) if it see's two requests for the same content in a rolling duration of 24 hours. This is well established CDN engineering wisdom and prevents disk churn on the L2s as most content is only ever requested once from a CDN node.

#### Serves CAR file retrievals over HTTP for an IPLD (root cid, selector) tuple

- The L2 node serves retrievals of CAR files over HTTP for a given (root cid, optional selector) tuple if it already has the requested DAG.

- If it does not have the requested DAG, it simply returns a 404 so the client can fetch it directly from the IPFS Gateway. This decision was taken keeping in mind that it will be faster for the client to fetch the content directly from the IPFS Gateway rather than the client downloading it from the L2 which is itself downloading the content from the IPFS Gateway. This is because the L2 clients i.e. L1 Saturn nodes have significantly superior bandwidth compared to L2s. Low L2 uplink speeds without the benefits of geo-location and without the implementation of multi-peer L2 downloads can definitely become a bottleneck for L1s in the L2 cache miss scenario.

- The L2 network does NOT support parallel download of a DAG from multiple L2 nodes for now.

### Dagstore as a cache for CAR files

- The L2 node uses the [dagstore](https://github.com/filecoin-project/dagstore) as a thread-safe, persistent, high-throughput and fixed sized cache for CAR files whose size we might not know upfront before we stream them from the origin server and download them. Filecoin SPs also use the dagstore for the same purpose i.e. a persistent cache for CAR files.

- The dagstore ensures that the space used to persist CAR files never exceeds the space allocated to the L2 node by the user. It does this by using an automated LRU GC algorithm to evict CAR files to make space for new CAR files when the space used by CAR files exceeds a given threshold. The LRU GC algorithm uses a quota allocation mechanism to account for the fact that the L2 node can't know the size of a CAR file upfront before streaming the entire file from the IPFS Gateway. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/dagstore/pull/125).

- The dagstore is source agnostic and it should be relatively easy to swap out the IPFS Gateway with the Filecoin SP network down the line without changing the L2 implementation significantly.

### HTTP API for retrieving content and getting L2 node stats

- The L2 node exposes an HTTP API to serve a CAR file for a given (root, optional selector).

- The L2 node also exposes an HTTP API to fetch stats that the operator/user of the L2 node might be interested in. These stats include the total amount of data downloaded by the L2 node, the amount of data served to other CDN peers by the L2 node etc etc.

## Setting up the L2 node and invoking the HTTP APIs

1. Build and Install the Saturn L2 binary located at cmd/saturn-l2.
   ```
   cd cmd/saturn-l2
   go build ./...
   ```

2. Run the saturn-l2 binary
   ```
   cd cmd/saturn-l2
   ./saturn-l2
   ```

   Note that before running the binary, you need to configure the following environment variables:
   ```
   1. `PORT`
       `PORT` is the environment variable that determines the port the saturn L2 service will bind to.
	    If this environment variable is not configured, this service will bind to any available port.

   2. `ROOT_DIR`
       `ROOT_DIR` is the environment variable that determines the root directory of the Saturn L2 Node.
	    All persistent state and cached CAR files will be persisted under this directory.
	    Note: This is a mandatory environment variable -> no default for now.

       The following state is currently persisted inside the root directory on the user's machine:

       a. CAR files fetched from the IPFS Gateway. This is the data that the Saturn L2 CDN 
          node is caching. These are stored as flat files on disk.
       b. Internal dagstore bookkeeping state. The indices for the cached CARv2 files are 
          persisted as flat files on disk and the state of each  dag/shard/CAR file is persisted in a 
          leveldb key-value store on disk.
       c. L2 node stats that the L2 user/Station might be interested in. These are persisted in JSON format 
          in a leveldb key-value store on disk.

   3. `MAX_L2_DISK_SPACE`
       `MAX_L2_DISK_SPACE` is the environment variable that determines the maximum disk space the L2 node
	   can use to store cached CAR files. If this env variable is not configured, it defaults to 200GiB.
	    Note: The configured value should be greater than or equal to 200Gib.

   4. `FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS`
       `FIL_WALLET_ADDRESS` is the environment variable that determines the Filecoin wallet address of the L2 user.
	    Note: This is a mandatory environment variable -> no default.
   ```




3. One the binary starts, it will print this to the standard output:

```
./saturn-l2
2022-07-21T11:30:34.226+0200	INFO	car-store	carstore/carstore.go:159	starting car store
2022-07-21T11:30:34.227+0200	INFO	car-store	carstore/carstore.go:173	successfully started car store
Server listening on 127.0.0.1:52860
WebUI: http://localhost:52860/webui

```


Note that the the Saturn L2 node only binds to the **localhost** loopback network interface and so will only be reachable from the same machine.
In the above snippet, `52860` is the port that the Saturn L2 node binds to on the localhost interface. This port can be configured using the `PORT` environment variable as mentioned above.

### HTTP APIs

1. GET **/stats**

```
curl http://localhost:52860/stats

Response:
{"Version":"v0.0.0",
"BytesCurrentlyStored":0, -> Total space currently taken up by the cached CAR files on the L2 user's machine.
"TotalBytesUploaded":0,   -> Total number of bytes uploaded/served by the L2 node to requesting peers in it's entire lifetime.
"TotalBytesDownloaded":0, -> Total number of bytes downloaded by the L2 node from the IPFS Gateway/origin server in it's entire lifetime.
"NContentRequests":0,     -> Total number of requests received by the L2 node for content from clients in it's entire lifetime.
"NContentReqErrors":0}    -> Total number of errors encountered by the L2 node while serving content to client in it's entire lifetime.
```

2. GET **/dag/car**

  **Request**
  ```
  {"ReqId":"00c1d646-7b06-445f-9162-1966c670f37d", // UUID for the request -> used for referencing, logging and debugging. Mandatory.
  "Root":"QmfMYyn8LUWEfRXfijKFjBAshSsPVRUgwLZzsD7kcTtX1A", // Base64 string encoding of the cid byte array. Mandatory.
  "Selector":"", // Base 64 string encoding of the selector byte array. Optional and can test without this for now.
  "SkipOffset":0 // Skip offset for the CAR to download. Optional. 
}
  ```

  **Response**
  ```
  Body: CAR file bytes are streamed

  Status Codes:
  404 -> L2 does not have the requested content.
  200 -> L2 has the requested content and CAR file bytes will be streamed back in the response body.
  500 -> Internal L2 error that we should probably look into.
  ```
